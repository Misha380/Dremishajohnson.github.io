# About Me
## My interest 
- I enjoy learning new things about computers and putting what I learned into my real life. One of my favorite hobbies would have to be designing, nothing too specfic but just the different routes you can take with designing are fun to explore.
## Websites I recommend
- My first web choice is [python](https://jupyter.org/). - I used this software while taking a programming and the different codes you could make on here were fun and easy to operate.
- My second web choice would be [blackboard](https://blackboard.waketech.edu/ultra/institution-page). - All the information you need from your class are located here and this website has a simple layout so you can have access to things like your grades or emails.
